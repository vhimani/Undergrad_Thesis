Demand for workers in high contact and inflexible service occupations has declined, while parental supply of labor has been reduced by lack of access to reliable child care and in-person schooling options. This has led to a substantial and persistent drop in employment and labor force participation for women, who are typically less affected by recessions than men. We examine real time data on employment, unemployment, labor force participation and gross job flows to document the gendered impact of the pandemic. We also discuss the potential long-term implications of this crisis, including the role of automation in depressing the recovery of employment for the worst hit service occupations.  aHardcopy version available to institutional subscribers  aSystem requirements: Adobe [Acrobat] Reader required for PDF files.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.0 aPrint version record 7aE24 - Employment &bull; Unemployment &bull; Wages &bull; Intergenerational Income Distribution &bull; Aggregate Human Capital &bull; Aggregate Labor Productivity2Journal of Economic Literature class. 7aJ16 - Economics of Gender &bull; Non-labor Discrimination2Journal of Economic Literature class. 7aJ2 - Demand and Supply of Labor2Journal of Economic Literature class. 7aJ21 - Labor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure2Journal of Economic Literature class. 7aJ23 - Labor Demand2Journal of Economic Literature class.1 aKim, Jiyeon.2 aNational Bureau of Economic Research. 0aWorking Paper Series (National Bureau of Economic Research)vno. w28505.40uhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w2850540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w28505
